# viriju

A sophomore computer science student at Kansas State University. I'm most interested in FOSS, web development, and visual design. I also have a casual interest in mathematics and game development.

I'm currently working on various [Typst](https://github.com/typst/typst) packages as I get through my summer courses.

My personal projects, which are generally coursework and Typst shenanigans, are on [Codeberg](https://codeberg.org/) (also as [viriju](https://codeberg.org/viriju)).
